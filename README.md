消方塊-手機遊戲

遊戲理念: 以消除全部方塊為目標

遊戲玩法: 

(1)兩個（含）以上同顏色的方塊若排在一起則可以消去

(2)若關卡內的方塊全部消完則血量（一開始為三點）＋１

(3)若有剩餘方塊且無法再消除，血量－１，血量為0又失敗即game over


關卡難度設計: 顏色會隨著level提高而增加，兩種顏色一關，三種顏色兩關……以此類推。

分數計算: 該次消除方塊數的平方。

提示設計: 提示只能使用三次，可以在中途使用，使用後會回到關卡一開始（分數亦然）。

提示步數: 提示70%（剩餘30%的星星需要玩家自行計算）。


無論是否Clear都會+1Level，玩家同一層層往上爬，遊玩情況有二：

(1)使用提示：分數會回到關卡一開始，但能有效達到更高Level。

(2)不使用提示：以較高的分數到達該層，玩家可互相比較Level和Score。

Block Elimination - Mobile Game

The objective is to eliminate all blocks.

Gameplay:

(1) Blocks of the same color, two or more placed together, can be eliminated.

(2) If all blocks in the level are eliminated, the health points (starting at three) increase by one.

(3) If there are remaining blocks that cannot be eliminated, one health point is deducted. If health points reach zero, it's game over.

Level Difficulty Design: The number of colors increases as the level progresses. For example, two colors for one level, three colors for two levels, and so on.

Score Calculation: The square of the number of blocks eliminated in a round.

Hint Design: Hints can only be used three times and can be used midway through the level. After using a hint, the game restarts at the beginning of the level (with the same score).

Hint Steps: Hints reveal 70% of the remaining blocks; players need to calculate the remaining 30% themselves.

Regardless of whether the level is cleared, the player advances to the next level. There are two scenarios:

(1) Using hints: The score resets to the beginning of the level but enables reaching higher levels more effectively.

(2) Not using hints: Players reach the level with a higher score, allowing them to compare levels and scores with others.
